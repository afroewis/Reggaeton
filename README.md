# Reggaeton
A PHP Client for MPD (music player daemon).

Reggaeton is the right tool to play music using PHP at your next party! It provides basic functionality to play and manage music: 
- Add files to your playlist
- List all tracks/genres/albums/...
- Play, stop, pause music


# Prerequisites
Obviously you'll need a healthy MPD installation to use Reggaeton. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon for more information about MPD.
